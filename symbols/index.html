                <div>Second:</div>
                <div>The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.</div>
                <div>This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago,</div>
                <div>to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: 
                the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books.</div>
                 <div>One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last.</div>
                <div>Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids.</div>
                <div>This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. </div>
                <div>(I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm...</div>
                <div>They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)</div>
                <div>For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.</div>
                 <div>All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail.</div>
                <div>Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.</div>
